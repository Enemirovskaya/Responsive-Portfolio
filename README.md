READ.ME file
I worked on my web-page named BetterCODE. It has header, main, footer.
Header has nav menu which takes to different parts of the menu: [About Me] is left empty for now, [Work] takes to section class=work, [Contact Me] leads to Footer, and [Resume] is linked to template resume from Wikipedia.
Work section has 5 background images. Which consists of two flex boxes, one for the top image and one for the 4 bottom ones. 
Footer includes contact information with navigation menu and hovering drop-down menu.
